## What is it?

It is a node based editor that allows you to create node based projects based on convention based plugins.

> This shows an early version of the editor using EcsRx plugin

## How do I use it?

> Currently you cannot get it without cloning the related repos for plugins/applications and building it yourself, once its past a prototype there will be official releases offered for install.

Once installed you create a project based on the available project templates (these are based on your plugins) and then create nodes based on the projects conventions.

Currently there is only an EcsRx plugin which allows you to create ECS related nodes for that project, however the eco system has been developed as an open platform for anyone to create their own code generation plugins.

## Plugins

Alchemist requires plugins to create content and generate code, so make sure you have a `plugins` folder and have included any of the plugins you need.

### I NEED HELP!

Go to the discord channel and ask for help there in the Alchemist room, this project is purely a prototype at the moment and will be so for a while.
